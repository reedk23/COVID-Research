## Abstract (tl;dr)
## Introduction
## Hypothesis
I am chossing to do a data set on Florida COVID cases. One variables I am thinking of exploring is on week of July 8 through the 15th the COVID cases increase tremendously to a whopping number of 75,291, and on July 12th Florida set a national record for the largest single day increase of postive cases. I believe this is due to the Holiday fourth of July, where people gather in large crowds to mingle and celebrate. Also on Saturday July 11 Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom at Disney opened, which also draws crowd.
