## Abstract (tl;dr)
Summer 2020 Ferris State University reproducible research project exploring from the beginning into Mid-March of cases in China vs. the rest of the World COVID cases and there trends.
## Introduction
This is a COVID research looking and predicting trends.
## Hypothesis
I am choosing to do  data sets on cases in china and the rest of the world. My hypothesis is that China would have numerous of cases and death since it originated from there as well as it would spread to other parts of the world.I knew and thought it would spread because of traveling. Also I think that the spread and total cases will decrease faster in China than other parts of the World.
## Datasets used
The raw data was put togeter by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering  https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/
## Description of analyses
I used ggpot to make line graphs from the raw data.
## Conclusion
In conclusion my hypothesis was correct, COVID 19 did spread to other countries and when it did the cases were at higher rate than China.
